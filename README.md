# Google Map Api Test

This project is made with React (create-react-app). Used styled Components and Ant Design

A friend of mine asked me how to use the google map api to "translate" some address to coordinates. I never used google maps api before, so i start reading the documentation and made this this little example. All you will need to run this project is the google maps api key [more Info](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)

Feel free to use as you wish.
